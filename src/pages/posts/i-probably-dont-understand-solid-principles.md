I've been a professional programmer for about three years. At least every other month since starting my illustrious career,
I've confused, misremembered, reinterpreted, revised or otherwise reconsidered changed my understanding of SOLID principles. I get the impression that this isn't entirely my fault.

Scouring the internet, you might find a blog explaining the Dependency Inversion Principle. Further browsing might take you to some
Reddit thread will contradict what you've just read. Your boss and coworkers will probably disagree with whatever you've read, and with each other.
I've seen internal coding standards documentation which defined Dependency Inversion to mean "depend on abstractions,
not concrete implementations," and then conveniently link to the Wikipedia article which defines DIP altogether
differently. The same documentation mandates that "All code should follow SOLID practices." Everybody has a different interpretation, and
everybody thinks theirs is the right one.

These observations are neatly compiled for the cynicisian's reading pleasure in the pertinent and perfectly simple StackOverflow question:
[_What is the dependency inversion principle and why is it important?_](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62539/what-is-the-dependency-inversion-principle-and-why-is-it-important)
Evidently, it's a harder question to answer than ask. The top reply is that of a highly-repped (read: knowledgeable)
user talking about the need to use interfaces to satisfy the Dependency Inversion Principle. You can see a more highly repped user
disagreeing with the explanation in the comments. Other answers conflate Dependency Inversion with Inversion of Control.
One of the answers has a crazy hexagon diagram stuck in there. One seems to agree with my current interpretation, but ask me again in six months.

Meanwhile, I've spent the last three years trying to actually apply these principles like an asshole.

In the real world, a lot of this stuff seems to go out of the window pretty quickly. There are some bad habits that persist, like sticking interfaces
on every class because it's "inverting the dependency so it's SOLID," or "to make it testable." But otherwise, developers
seem to be aware, consciously or not, that applying SOLID dogmatically wherever and whenever you can is a bad idea.
Developers don't invert the dependency on the .NET Framework. We don't religiously segregate every interface from every client.
We would never create entire plugin systems where simple `switch` or `if` statements suffice, though I have been told
that such an approach would be better.

There can be some crazy stuff that comes out of the people responsible for designing coding standards and best practices
when they canonise SOLID. I've worked with standards that rather than calibrating to the needs of each system,
instead broadly require _insane_ design patterns are used for the simplest of projects in the name of SOLID. I've seen perfectly serviceable
repositories thrown out in favour of batshit CQS implementations simply because the author of those standards considered
them more SOLID. The principles slow things down, cause confusion, make people less productive and, ironically, can make the codebase
harder to maintain when applied too broadly.

My best guess is that SOLID is a vogue conversation piece. A technique thought essential for every programmer to master,
lest they are unable to write maintainable software. A fun topic to argue about, and more fun to show off about.
A good way for us to swing our dicks about and compare who's more, er, SOLID.

During the interview at my current place of employment, the interviewers asked me to explain SOLID principles.
I rattled off some gibberish definitions, I think lifted from Wikipedia and then mangled by memory and pressure.
It was something I would definitely not recognise as SOLID; I didn't really recognise it at the time. I still got the job. And I don't think I was—or am—a horrible
developer for my lack of clarity and changeability on the matter. Given its universality as an acronym and conversation material,
it might be adequate for interviewers to confirm that candidates are merely aware of the principles, and bother to spend time reading about them online. Flawed understanding or
not, it demonstrates some initiative and ability to self-learn. Even if it is just recycled Reddit crap.

My own experience with SOLID is mixed. I've overcomplicated things before, applied interfaces to everything
(which stemmed from a bad interpretation of DIP) and worried about things I didn't need to because
I thought my code absolutely _had_ to be SOLID through-and-through. I can only speak to my own reasons for falling into
these traps, but I suspect many will empathise; for me, it was a case of insecurity and lack of certainty that what I
was writing was maintainable or correct. All the talk of SOLID, which other people seem so confident and assured about, makes
you overcompensate for gaps in your own knowledge. That isn't helped by much of the Google material on the subject
being contradictory or nonsensical.

Having said all this, I'm a fan of SOLID. But it's useful to remember that the word _fan_ comes from the term _fanatic_.
To me, it's a collection of sensible ideas that usually apply, in principle, to languages and systems that aren't
just C++, Java or C#. A fact which some people don't notice. In hindsight, I wish I'd had the understanding I currently have.
Some of the mistakes I've made when creating software could have been mitigated by sensible
application of the principles as I see them now, though it goes without saying some of those problems wouldn't have existed were it easier
to avoid some of the sillier interpretations of SOLID. I suppose the adage _you have to fail before you fly_ holds up!

Developers tend to have a certain level of pride in their knowledge and expertise. It's good to be passionate about one's craft
and respect the time you've invested in yourself to learn it. However, when confronted with
hack-bullshit it's easy to think less, professionally, of the person spouting it. I've been there with regards to SOLID,
and I'm sure others experience similar thoughts about my opinions. But you might be surprised to find out just how many people have a different understanding
of the principles to yours. To the extent that it's almost completely useless to gauge someone's ability based on their
knowledge of SOLID.

Most recently, I've learned to have more confidence in myself and my work. That's not to say I'm not sceptical or
critical of what I write, I absolutely try to be, but only that I now feel less like I need to program on rails. SOLID principles make for great guidelines,
but it doesn't seem useful to let them become more than that. When you find yourself zealously combing through code
trying to "make it as SOLID as possible", it could be time to temper your fervour and reach a compromise with imperfection,
which usually turns out to be simplicity.

For others having difficulty grasping the amusingly gaseous ideas of SOLID as explained by much of the internet, I would highly recommend
checking out the original Uncle Bob papers that introduced the acronym [here](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod).
