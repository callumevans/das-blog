"Microservices vs. Monoliths" has probably been the biggest source of controversy between myself and the generally less attractive
denizens of Manchester I socialise with. Having regularly reflected on and revisited the topic for a few years now, I've
found it harder and harder to make sense of the terminology.

I've worked at a couple of companies that have tried to make the transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices.
One of them was spurred on by stories from technical powerhouses like Twilio and Uber. The excited, possibly naive,
optimism we all regurgitated around the office and pub might be familiar to some. 

>"Twilio have a bunch of microservices. They put them together like lego to create even more functionality, like building blocks. We should do that!"

>"Uber have thousands of microservices. They're very successful. They're very technical. If microservices work for them they should work for us."

And, to be fair, they sort of did work for us.

In this case, our older monolithic architecture was a typically unwieldy ASP Web Forms application that did everything. It worked (and, I hear, still does) very well.
There were problems with its maintainability, however. And not necessarily due to bad code. I'd guess it was mostly considered 'bad' due to the fact it was legacy, which
inevitably carries baggage; it was harder for the newer developers to understand, which churn exacerbated over time. There were also things
the business wanted to do that made more sense as greenfield projects. Over the course of a few months, a squad structure emerged that promoted
self-ownership of most areas of the tech-stack, leaving developers a lot of autonomy with how solutions were implemented.

Speed of delivery was the aim of the game, and what we called microservices provided a solution that fit in with how we worked.

We developers have peculiar obsession with perfectionism: code has to be [as SOLID as possible](../i-probably-dont-understand-solid-principles/);
whatever we write should be able to stand-up to business requirements 1/2/3/X years from now; you should be able to swap out
your SQL Server database with MongoDB, "just in case". This mentality can lead to some unfortunate software design decisions, where systems are
built to stand up to imagined criteria that will _never_ materialise. In many businesses, particularly startups, time is the most valuable resource, and
the time it takes to deliver a piece of software could be the metric that deserves the most attention.



###

Started career at a company that was looking to move towards microservices. Stories from Twilio and Uber.
Legacy code was unmaintainable (legacy is just something written before before a developer was there).

What is a monolith?
What is a microservice?
(vaguely: monolith is a big thing that does a lot; microservice is something smaller that does less)

Recursive microservice calls are a typical problem, however performance + maintainability issues are often one of the reasons to move away from a big monolith.

Question Steve asked Goach about SOA vs Microservices got me thinking.

Microservices aren't new (SOA)


Problems with monoliths lead people to want to do microservices.
Problems with microservices lead people to say 'maybe monoliths are better'.

Didn't really know what we were talking about. Did it matter? Let us move at speed, which is crucial for any startup.

Never really understood them; lot's of definitions. Typically confusing.

Size not necessarily best way of determining whether to go from monolith to microservice.

People have been jumping between microservices and monoliths and complaining about both of them forever.

Structure is never going to be right - especially in a lot of startups; as business evolves, so do requirements.
Can't design for everything.

SPAs might have helped with adoption of microservices this time around.
Difficulties of debugging

Don't necessarily need to classify them? Whatever works best / feels most natural. Saying "Twilio do Microservices = let's copy Twilio". Might not work.

Legacy code is just generally considered bad. People hate whatever is there before they got there.
