I've worked at a couple of places that tried to make the transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices.
One of them was spurred on by stories from technical powerhouses like Twilio and Uber. The excited, possibly naive,
optimism we all regurgitated around the office and pub might be familiar to some.
"_Uber have thousands of microservices. They're very successful. They're very technical. If microservices work for them they should work for us._"
And, to be fair, it sort of did work for us.



###
Started career at a company that was looking to move towards microservices. Stories from Twilio and Uber.
Legacy code was unmaintainable (legacy is just something written before before a developer was there).

What is a monolith?
What is a microservice?
(vaguely: monolith is a big thing that does a lot; microservice is something smaller that does less)

Problems with monoliths lead people to want to do microservices.
Problems with microservices lead people to say 'maybe monoliths are better'.

Question Steve asked Goach about SOA vs Microservices got me thinking.

Didn't really know what we were talking about. Did it matter? Let us move at speed, which is crucial for any startup.

Microservices aren't new (SOA)

People have been jumping between microservices and monoliths and complaining about both of them forever.

Structure is never going to be right - especially in a lot of startups; as business evolves, so do requirements.
Can't design for everything.

Legacy code is just generally considered bad. People hate whatever is there before they got there.
