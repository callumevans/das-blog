"Microservices vs. Monoliths" has probably been the biggest source of controversy between myself and the generally less attractive
denizens of Manchester I socialise with. Having regularly reflected on and revisited the topic for a few years now, I've
found it harder and harder to make sense of the terminology.

I've worked at a couple of companies that have tried to make the transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices.
One of them was spurred on by stories from technical powerhouses like Twilio and Uber. The excited, possibly naive,
optimism we all regurgitated around the office and pub might be familiar to some. 

>"Twilio have a bunch of microservices. They put them together like lego to create even more functionality, like building blocks. We should do that!"

>"Uber have thousands of microservices. They're very successful. They're very technical. If microservices work for them they should work for us."

And, to be fair, they sort of did work for us.

In this case, our older monolithic architecture was a typically unwieldy ASP Web Forms application that did everything. It worked (and, I hear, still does) very well.
There were problems with its maintainability, however. And not necessarily due to bad code. I'd guess it was considered bad due to the simple fact it was just legacy, which
carries some baggage; it was harder for the newer developers to understand, which churn exacerbated over time. There were also things
the business wanted to do that made more sense as greenfield projects. Over the course of a few months, a squad structure emerged that promoted
self-ownership of large areas of the tech-stack, leaving a lot of autonomy with how solutions were implemented. 

###

Started career at a company that was looking to move towards microservices. Stories from Twilio and Uber.
Legacy code was unmaintainable (legacy is just something written before before a developer was there).

What is a monolith?
What is a microservice?
(vaguely: monolith is a big thing that does a lot; microservice is something smaller that does less)

Recursive microservice calls are a typical problem, however performance + maintainability issues are often one of the reasons to move away from a big monolith.

Question Steve asked Goach about SOA vs Microservices got me thinking.

Microservices aren't new (SOA)

Problems with monoliths lead people to want to do microservices.
Problems with microservices lead people to say 'maybe monoliths are better'.

Didn't really know what we were talking about. Did it matter? Let us move at speed, which is crucial for any startup.

Never really understood them; lot's of definitions. Typically confusing.


People have been jumping between microservices and monoliths and complaining about both of them forever.

Structure is never going to be right - especially in a lot of startups; as business evolves, so do requirements.
Can't design for everything.

SPAs might have helped with adoption of microservices this time around.
Don't necessarily need to classify them? Whatever works best / feels most natural.

Legacy code is just generally considered bad. People hate whatever is there before they got there.
