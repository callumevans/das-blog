"Microservices vs. Monoliths" has probably been the biggest source of controversy between myself and the substantially less attractive denizens of Manchester that I usually socialise with. Having regularly reflected on and revisited the topic for a few years now, I've found it harder and harder to make sense of the terminology.

We developers have peculiar obsession with perfectionism: code has to be [as SOLID as possible](../i-probably-dont-understand-solid-principles/); whatever we write should be able to stand-up to business requirements 1/2/3/X years from now; you should be able to swap out your SQL Server database with MongoDB, "just in case". This mentality can lead to some unfortunate software design decisions, where systems are built to stand up to imagined criteria that will _never_ materialise. In many businesses, particularly startups, time is the most valuable resource, and the time it takes to deliver a piece of software could be the metric that deserves the most attention.

Given that line of thinking, there's an argument to be made that blasting out a single, slick and cohesive API and calling it a monolith is faster than dealing with the allegedly veritable hellscape of juggling dozens of services, deployments, nodes, clusters and, dare I say, pods. And whilst this _can_ be true, it definitely isn't _always_ true.

I've worked at a couple of companies that have tried to make the transition from a monolithic architecture to microservices. One of them was spurred on by stories from technical powerhouses like Twilio and Uber. The excited, possibly naive, optimism we all regurgitated around the office and pub might be familiar to some. 

>"Twilio have a bunch of microservices. They put them together like lego to create even more functionality, like building blocks. We should do that!"

>"Uber have thousands of microservices. They're very successful. They're very technical. If microservices work for them they should work for us."

And, to be fair, they mostly did work for us.

In this case, our older monolithic architecture was a typically unwieldy ASP Web Forms application that did everything. It worked (and, I hear, still does) very well. There were problems with its maintainability, however. And not necessarily due to bad code. I figure it was mostly considered 'bad' due to the fact it was legacy, which inevitably carries baggage; it was harder for the newer developers to understand, which churn exacerbated over time. There were also things the business wanted to do that made more sense as greenfield projects. Over the course of a few months, a squad structure emerged that promoted self-ownership of most areas of the tech-stack, leaving developers a lot of autonomy with how solutions were implemented. Speed of delivery was the aim of the game, and what we called microservices provided a solution that fit in nicely with how we worked.

That's not to say our approach was without its own problems. We weaved a tangled web of APIs. Services didn't so much talk to each other as they did perform some x-rated parody of a Vulcan mind meld. A single inbound HTTP request to a public-facing could easily generate a further two or three internal HTTP requests, and then _they_ risked snowballing into additional requests; any one of links in this chain of requests failing or not returning what it was expected to was a potential point of failure. Scalability was also made more difficult due to this behaviour. If one chatty service was given multiple instances, it would make little to no difference if the various services it talks to weren't also scaled with it.

This unenviable situation is sometimes described as a _distributed monolith_, wherein your architecture features few of the benefits associated with a microservices architecture but has all of the problems. Everything's coupled together, and breaking, scaling or otherwise changing one service affected everything else.

But it did work. And for all our bad decisions and sloppily written services, we were able to develop new services and make ideas a reality quickly, in an increasingly competitive marketplace and deliver some unique, albeit often unpolished, experiences for customers and staff.

Though I don't believe this to be a triumph of a microservices architecture per-se. Rather, it was a testament to the way we worked as a development team. The autonomy of each squad, with their own aims and objectives that in-turn contributed to the business' goals, allowed us to work with the productivity of, arguably, _multiple_ startups. It was only natural that each squad would build their own services, with their own processes and practices, in a way that worked for them.

It's likely that we jumped on some of the definitions too hard. We were eager to "_do microservices_", and we probably weren't content with just having something that worked for us. We had conference calls with other companies. We went to some talks and read some blogs. "_Microservices are agile!_", "_Microservices are scalable_", "_Microservices will make your dick bigger_" and other such delectable buzzword soups are still pretty common.

Suffice it to say, microservices were the in-thing and we definitely wanted to be a part of the hype. We were keen to emulate Uber and Twilio in particular, with their 2000+ microservices. Not realising that they're also global, building atop infrastructure they've spent years developing, and had literally 100x the developers we had. 

Also, it was probably the case that many companies would present talks or publish blog posts detailing their experiences with microservices simply because that was a vogue topic and a shit-hot SEO keyword, which we, perhaps, didn't digest as critically as we should have done.

The notion of _2000+ services_ almost seemed to become the goal in its own right. Our idea of success was measured, in part, by how many services we had.

The microservices bandwagon might not even be a wagon. There is an ongoing curiosity amongst we developers whom are trying to get our misshapen heads around some of this fancy vernacular. What is a monolith, and what is a microservice _exactly_? Any what's this _service orientated architecture_ malarkey we keep hearing about? Well, dear reader, I'm sorry to say I can provide no clear answers. Much like every other topic in our esteemed industry, it very much depends on whom you ask.

As far as I can piece together from what people say, what I've read and what I've seen, a _monolith_ can be defined as any vaguely large, singular piece of infrastructure or code. A _microservice_ is, also vaguely, a smaller piece of infrastructure or code that _might_ make up some greater-whole of the system, along with other similarly sized pieces of infrastructure. 

trapped in vicious circle; that's the real development cycle

Microservices aren't new (SOA)

Conways Law

Can just rewrite services if they're shit.

Problems with monoliths lead people to want to do microservices.
Problems with microservices lead people to say 'maybe monoliths are better'.

Never really understood them; lot's of definitions. Typically confusing.

Size not necessarily best way of determining whether to go from monolith to microservice.

People have been jumping between microservices and monoliths and complaining about both of them forever.

Structure is never going to be right - especially in a lot of startups; as business evolves, so do requirements.
Can't design for everything.

SPAs might have helped with adoption of microservices this time around.
Difficulties of debugging

Don't necessarily need to classify them? Whatever works best / feels most natural. Saying "Twilio do Microservices = let's copy Twilio". Might not work.

Legacy code is just generally considered bad. People hate whatever is there before they got there.

Sometimes, having a separate thing is easier than having a big thing at the time you come to actually build it.
Don't need to overthink it. Underlying infrastructure is important. A lot of problems come from trying to adapt older
'cloud' providers to microservices. The more popular ones are built with them in mind.
